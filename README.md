# Personal Portfolio
This is the third iteration of my Personal Portfolio that highlights my work and technical skills. It includes my contact information and a little bit about me.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** React.js, Tailwind, JavaScript, Framer-Motion

I made this portfolio using React and used Tailwind to style. I used some third party like Framer-motion to animate certain sections of the site. 

## Optimizations

Optimizations planned for this project are refactoring code and improving accessability across all devices.

## Lessons Learned:

During this project I improved my framer-motion skills. I also learned how to use the react forms hook to make a contact form that sends emails directly to my inbox. Lastly, I learned how to create a dynamic nav bar as well as providing navigation buttons on desktop to provide easy site navigation.
